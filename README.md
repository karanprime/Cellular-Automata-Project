# Cellular-Automata-Project
Cellular automata simulations using arduino and java

The results of the simulation are in the file Shah_Tan_David_Cellular_Automata_Paper.pdf.

The main code file is ca.java. To run it, compile it using "javac ca.java" and run it using  "appletviewer ca.java".
Randgen is a random number generator from scratch using rule 30.
Arduino .ino files are in the respective arduino folders. arduinoCodeRing uses an led ring to represent each state of the cellular automata. arduinoGameOfLife is an led matrix for game of life.
