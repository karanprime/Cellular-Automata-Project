Read me:

The main java applet is ca.java
It has 4 modes: 1. Game of Life
                2. Spiral Wave
                3. Elementary Cellular Automata
                4. Comparison

Note about Mode 3: 
Set size by changing column size
Using rule 90 with size 64 will lead to disappering sierpinsky triangle.
Play around with both kinds of boundaries. 

RandGen.java is our own implementation of a random number generator using elementary CA rule 30, run it in terminal.

The programs in folders are arduino programs, they might be VERY buggy.

Have fun,
